# - The second exam date is October 28 and this exam will also be a remote exam. Please register via KLIPS if you want to participate. You will be able to download the exam here on October 28, 10am. Please, send your solution as an Email attachment (pdf, jpg or png) to c.schottmueller at uni-koeln dot de by 11:30am.
# - There was some technical issue with the screencast upload. As a result the [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/5sWSJ#n7VsMyNRyBLszIHnUrQzXA][link]] has changed.
# - The exam is on Mo, July 20 between 16:00 and 17:30. Please, register via KLIPS. 
- Please watch the first three [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/5sWSJ#n7VsMyNRyBLszIHnUrQzXA][screencasts]] before April 15. Also work on the exercises for rationalizability until then. See the time schedule below for details.
- Due to the recent pan(dem)ic, this course was moved online by university administration. A zoom link will be sent around via email briefly before the start of the semester (if you are not registered via KLIPS but want to attend anyway, please send me an Email). It would be useful to have a copy of the MasColell/Whinston/Green book by the start of the term. 
# - The second exam attempt will be on October 2, 16:00-17:00 in SSC 3.206. Registration via Klips is open.
# - On July ?, we use the class for question hour. If you want to have an answer for sure, please send me your questions before July ?. 
# - Updated slides (lecture June 27): added an explanation at the end of the slides why ex ante budget balance is sufficient for ex post budget balance; changed almost efficient mechanism for many seller/buyer setting such that it is dominant strategy incentive compatible for finite $m$ and $n$
# - resit date: October 7, 16:00-17:00 in SSC 4.210
# - exam date: July 8, 16:00-17:30 in 101/05/524 

* Time and place
# - Monday 16:00-17:30, Seminarraum S24 (106/02/2.03)
# - Wednesday, 10:00-11:30, Seminarraum S14 (106/01/1.03)
Meetings are conducted via zoom using the same zoom room as in the invitation for the first week. Unless stated otherwise, meetings are on Thursday 14:00-15:30am. Before the meeting you should have watched the screencasts on the topic of the week and tried to solve the exercises on this topic on your own. In the meeting, you have the opportunity to ask questions on the screencasts and we will also go through the exercises (quickly).

* Prerequisites
I assume that you have some introductory knowledge of game theory on the level of cite:gibbons1992primer. In particular, you should know the material in chapters 1 and 2 in Gibbons' book (strategic form games, dominance, mixed strategies, mixed and pure Nash equilibrium, extensive form games, game trees, backwards induction, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) and be able to apply it in simple games. From Advanced Microeconomics I, we built upon the part about /decision making under uncertainty/ (expected utility theorem). In terms of mathematics, it is helpful if you master the material of the course /Advanced Mathematics for Economists/. Having said that, most of the used math tools will not be far beyond high school maths. At the minimum you have to know (partial) differentiation, integration and optimization of functions and basic statistics (discrete and continuous probability distributions, expected values as well as Bayes' rule and conditional probabilities). More importantly, you should also have some idea of what a mathematical proof is.

# * Plan
# The idea is to have  every third class as an exercise session dealing with the material of the two previous lectures. /You are expected to have tried to solve the exercises beforehand/ (and hopefully you succeeded with some of them), i.e. in the exercise classes we deal with your questions and problems and we are /not/ solving the exercises there from scratch. If you feel that making additional exercises would help you, you find more exercises in cite:mas1995microeconomic. (I am told that a solution manual exists and is not too hard to find.)

* Books

Most material is covered in cite:mas1995microeconomic which is abbreviated MWG in the following. Roughly speaking, we will cover chapters 8, 9, 13 and 23 from this book and -- as time permits -- add a few papers on topics not covered in MWG towards the end of the course.

Some other interesting books on game theory covering the course material partially are
- cite:fudenberg1991game (FT): Covers an impressive amount of material in considerable depth at PhD level. Some of the proofs are, however, not fully worked out.
- cite:maschler2013game (MSZ): Impresses with very clear proofs and fully worked out examples. Do, however, not expect to find much economics in this book.
- cite:osborne1994course (OR). A very nice book that is freely available for download from the authors' websites. 

For mechanism design, cite:boergers2015 is an excellent source which naturally covers much more than we do in the course.

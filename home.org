* Prerequisites
I assume that you have some introductory knowledge of game theory on the level of cite:gibbons1992primer. In particular, you should know the material in chapters 1 and 2 in Gibbons' book (strategic form games, dominance, mixed strategies, mixed and pure Nash equilibrium, extensive form games, game trees, backwards induction, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) and be able to apply it in simple games. From Advanced Microeconomics I, we built upon the part about /decision making under uncertainty/ (expected utility theorem). In terms of mathematics, it is helpful if you master the material of the course /Advanced Mathematics for Economists/. Having said that, most of the used math tools will not be far beyond high school maths. At the minimum you have to know (partial) differentiation, integration and optimization of functions and basic statistics (discrete and continuous probability distributions, expected values as well as Bayes' rule and conditional probabilities). Ideally, you should also have some idea of what a mathematical proof is.

* Plan
We have 15*2=30 meetings. The idea is to have 20 lectures and 10 exercise classes, i.e. every third class we talk about exercises dealing with the material of the two previous lectures. /You are expected to have tried to solve the exercises beforehand/ (and hopefully you succeeded with some of them), i.e. in the exercise classes we deal with your questions and problems and we are /not/ solving the exercises there from scratch.

* Books

Most material is covered in cite:mas1995microeconomic which is abbreviated MWG in the following. Roughly speaking, we will cover chapters 8, 9, 13 and 23 from this book and -- as time permits -- add a few papers on topics not covered in MWG towards the end of the course.

Some other interesting books on game theory covering the course material partially are
- cite:fudenberg1991game (FT): Covers an impressive amount of material in considerable depth at PhD level. Some of the proofs are, however, not fully worked out.
- cite:maschler2013game (MSZ): Impresses with very clear proofs and fully worked out examples. Do, however, not expect to find much economics in this book.
- cite:osborne1994course (OR). A very nice book that is freely available for download from the authors' websites. 

For mechanism design, cite:boergers2015 is an excellent source which naturally covers much more than we do in the course.

* Games of incomplete information
** A first example I
- an incumbent decides whether to build a new plant (I for invest)  at cost $c_I$
- entrant simultaneously decides whether to enter (E)
- entrant does not know whether $c$ is "low" (/l/) or "high" (/h/)

#+Caption: Payoffs with $c_I=h$
|    | E    | NE  |
|----+------+-----|
| /  | <    |     |
| I  | 0,-1 | 2,0 |
| NI | 2,1  | 3,0 |
#+Caption: Payoffs with $c_I=l$
|    | E      | NE    |
|----+--------+-------|
| /  | <      |       |
| I  | 1.5,-1 | 3.5,0 |
| NI | 2,1    | 3,0   |

- $p$: prior probability entrant assigns to /h/

** A first example II

- what will the incumbent do if $c_I=h$?
# dominant to play NI
- what should the incumbent do if $c_I=l$?
# depends on belief y that P2 plays E: I if 1.5y+3.5(1-y)>2y+3(1-y), i.e. if y<1/2
- what should entrant do?
# tricky: depends on what he believes about incumbetn type and about what incumbent believes about him entering etc.

** Harsanyi's trick I
- suppose "nature" chooses the incumbent's *type* in a first step: $h$ with prob $p$ and $l$ with prob $1-p$
- then players play simultaneous move game but only incumbent observes nature's move
- strategy: complete plan of action, i.e. action choice for every type
  - incumbent: prob of investment when /h/ and prob of investment when /l/
- solve for Nash equilibrium in new game in which players' strategy sets are complete plans of actions for each and every type (they could have had)

\vspace*{1cm}
- Harsanyi's trick transforms incomplete information (not knowing $c$) into imperfect information (not knowing nature's move)

** A first example III
- optimal not to invest if /h/ \rightarrow only prob of investment when /l/ relevant, called $x$ 
- entrant optimally enters if $p+(1-p)(-1x+1(1-x))>0$ \Leftrightarrow $x<1/(2(1-p))$
- low cost incumbent optimally invests if $y<1/2$

- equilibria: 
# x=1, y=0 is eq if p<1/2; x=0 and y=1 is eq.; if p<1/2 also mixed eq.: y=1/2 and x=1/(2(1-p)) 


* Bayesian Nash equilibrium
** Bayesian game/ Static game of incomplete information

-  Bayesian game is denoted by $[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\},\Theta,F]$ where
  - $\Theta =\Theta_1\times\dots\times\Theta_I$ and $\Theta_i$ is player $i$'s set of possible types
  - $F$ is a probability distribution over $\Theta$
  - $u_i:S\times\Theta_i\rightarrow\Re$
- let $\mathcal{S}_i=\{s:\Theta_i\rightarrow S_i\}$ be the set of functions assigning to each type of player $i$ a strategy in $S_i$
- let $\tilde u_i(s_1(\cdot),\dots,s_I(\cdot))=\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[u_i(s_1(\theta_1),\dots,s_I(\theta_I),\theta_i)]$ be the expected utility of $i$ if players use strategies $\{s_i\}$

*** Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
A (pure) Bayesian Nash equilibrium in $[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\},\Theta,F]$ is a profile of decision rules $(s_1(\cdot),\dots,s_I(\cdot))$ that constitutes a (pure) Nash equilibrium in the game $[I,\{\mathcal{S}_i\},\{\tilde u_i\}]$, i.e. 
$$\tilde{u}_i(s_i(\cdot),\dots,s_{-i}(\cdot))\geq \tilde{u}_i (s_i'(\cdot),\dots,s_{-i}(\cdot))$$
for all $s_i'\in\mathcal{S}_i$.

** Another characterization of BNE

- $(s_1(\cdot),\dots,s_I(\cdot))$ is BNE if no type (of any player) can increase his expected payoff by deviating

*** Lemma (BNE in finite games)
A decision profile $(s_1(\cdot),\dots,s_I(\cdot))$ is a BNE if and only if for all $i$ and all $\bar \theta_i\in\Theta_i$ occurring with positive probability
$$\mathbb{E}_{\theta_{-i}}[u_i(s_i(\bar\theta_i),s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}),\theta_i)|\bar\theta_i]\geq \mathbb{E}_{\theta_{-i}}[u_i(s_i',s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}),\theta_i)|\bar\theta_i]$$
for all $s_i'\in S_i$.

*** :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

# \textbf{Proof.}
# - say $(s_1(\cdot),\dots,s_I(\cdot))$ is BNE. If $\bar\theta_i$ could profitably deviate then a strategy that chooses the profitbale deviation whenever $i$ has type $\bar \theta_i$ (and otherwise playing according to $s_i$) is a profitable deviation in the extended game which contradicts BNE.
# - Say not profitable deviation exists for any $\bar\theta_i$. Then no profitable deviation $s_i\in\mathcal{S}_i$ can exist as $i$'s expected utility $\tilde u_i$ is additively separable in his own type.

* Examples

** Public good game I
- two neighboring cities have to decide whether to build an airport
- airport can be used by citizens of both cities and this gives each city a payoff normalized to 1
- cost of city $i$ of building airport is $c_i$ and is $i$'s private information
- prior: $c_i\sim u[0,1]$ (drawn independently)
- payoffs 
|    | B           | NB      |
|----+-------------+---------|
| /  | <           |         |
| B  | 1-c_{1},1-c_2 | 1-c_{1},1 |
| NB | 1,1-c_2     | 0,0     |

- strategy: $s_i:[0,1]\rightarrow \{B,NB\}$

** Public good game II
- $B$ is optimal for $P_i$ if $1-c_i>x$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $c_i<1-x$ where $x$ is the belief that $-i$ builds 
   - optimal strategy is a cutoff rule
# as $x$ does not depend on $c_i$
   - at cutoff: indifference
   - prob of /B/ is prob of $c_i$ below cutoff
- what is (symmetric) equilibrium cutoff?
# 1/2

** Generalized public good game
- $I$ players decide to contribute ($C$) or not ($N$)
- payoff 1 if at least one player contributes 
- costs $c_i$ if contributing distributed on $[0,1]$ with continuous cdf $\Phi$
   - full support assumption: density $\phi>0$ on $[0,1]$
- $C$ is optimal if $1-c_i>x\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad c_i<1-x$
   - cutoff strategy is optimal
- what is probability that no other player contributes in a symmetric equilibrium with cutoff $c^*$?
# (1-\Phi(c^*))^{I-1}
- which condition has to be satisfied in symmetric equilibrium?
# 1-c^*=1-(1-\Phi(c^*))^{I-1} or equivalently c^*-(1-\Phi(c^*))^{I-1}=0
- if the number of players increases, will the equilibrium cutoff be higher or lower?
# IFT: d c^*/d I = -(-ln(1-\Phi(c^*))*((1-\Phi(c^*))^{I-1}))/(1+(I-1)*(1-\Phi(c^*))^{I-2}\phi(c^*))<0


** 2 player all pay auction with exponential type distribution
- 2 players choose effort $s_i$
- payoff: $\theta_i-s_i$ if $s_i>s_j$ and $-s_i$ else
- $\theta_i$ are private info and distributed independently on $[0,\infty)$ with cdf $\Phi(\theta_i)=1-e^{-\theta_i}$ (pdf $e^{-\theta_i}$)
- we derive symmetric equilibrium $s(\theta_i)$
- it can be shown that equilibrium strategy $s$ has to be strictly increasing in $\theta _i$
   - strictly increasing inverse of $s$ exists and is denoted by $t$
   - what is probability that other player bids less than $b$ (in equilibrium)?
   # $\Phi(t(b))=1-e^{-t(b)}$

- what is expected payoff of $i$ when bidding $b$ (given other player uses equilibrium strategy)?
   # $(1-e^{-t(b)})\theta_i-b$
- which condition characterizes $i$'s best response to equilibrium strategy $s$?
   # foc: $\theta _ie^{-t(b)}t'(b)-1=0$
   # in eq: $t(b) e^{-t(b)}t'(b)=1$, differential equation can be solved numerically with initial value $t(0)=0$; analytical solution is $t(b)=-W((b-1)/e)-1$ where W is Lambertz W function which can be inverted to get $s(\theta_i)=1-(1+\theta_i)e^{-\theta_i}$

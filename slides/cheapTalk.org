* Intro
** Introduction
- signaling: "message" has payoff consequences
- cheap talk: "message" has  no payoff consequences
  - easy: no differences in interest
    - "be careful there comes the bus"
  - today: different objectives
    - expert advice to decision maker but the expert has own agenda --> incentives to manipulate advice
  #  - central bank inflation forecast influences fiscal policy --> incentives to manipulate forecast?
  # doctor in NL

    - stylized model of cheap talk when the \emph{sender} and the \emph{receiver} of the message have (partially) different objectives

** Setup
two players: a sender $S$ and a receiver $R$
- sender observes state of the world $\theta\in\Theta$ (receiver does not)
- sender sends a message $m\in M$ to the receiver where $M$ is a set of all possible messages
- receiver takes an action $a\in A$ where $A$ is the set of all possible actions
- payoffs: $u^R(a,\theta )$ and $u^S(a,\theta)$
- note that $m$ does not enter the utility functions!
- equilibrium: weak PBE

** A (too) simple example I
- let $\Theta =\{0, 1\}$, $A=\{0,1\}$ and  $M=\{0,1\}$ 
- payoffs:

\begin{center}
    \begin{game}{2}{2}[action][state]
      \> 0 \> 1 \\
0    \> 1,x   \> 0,y    \\
1    \> 0,0  \> 1,z
    \end{game}
\end{center}

- R wants to match state
- the message could denote the state of the world, i.e. S sends $m=0$ if $\theta=0$ and $m=1$ if $\theta =1$
- when should R believe the message?

- say S has same preferences as R ($x=z=1$, $y<1$)
  - what are the equilibria?
# babbling and truthful communication

- say S always likes the action to be 1, i.e. $x>0$ and $y>z$
    - equilibrium?
- say S prefers a=1 if $\theta =0$ and a=0 if $\theta =1$, i.e. $x<0$ and $y>z$
    - equilibrium?

** A (too) simple example II
 - meaningful communication is only possible if the interests are aligned
- is this always true or can we get ``partial communication'' in a richer setting?

* Crawford and Sobel
** Standard setup
- $\Theta =[0,1]$ and $A=[0,1]$ 
- R has a prior that $\theta$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$
- messages are real numbers in $[0,1]$ 
- $u^R(a,\theta )=-(a-\theta )^2$, i.e. R wants to play an action that equals the state
- $u^S(a,\theta )=-(a-\theta -b)^2$ for some $b\geq0$, i.e. S wants R to play an action that is $b$ higher than the state

** Negative results
*** Lemma							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:
  If $b\neq0$, there is no BNE where the sender truthfully reports the state, i.e. no BNE where $m(\theta )=\theta$.

    :END:
  There exists a completely uninformative equilibrium (babbling equilibrium), e.g. $m(\theta)=0$ for any state and $a=1/2$ for any message.

*Proof?*

** Partial communication
- could there be an equilibrium where S sends a  /low message/ (/l/) if $\theta<\hat\theta$ and a /high message/ (/h/) else?
  - what would be R's actions after message /l/ and /h/ in such an equilibrium?
  - (what receiver beliefs could we choose for other -- off path -- messages to deter such deviations?)
  - for which value of $\hat\theta$ would S actually stick to the strategy?
  # $\hat\theta$ has to be indifferent between the two messages, i.e. $-(\hat\theta/2-\hat\theta-b)=(1+\hat\theta)/2-\hat\theta-b$, i.e. \hat\theta=-2b+1/2
 \pause

*** Lemma							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
For $b<1/4$, there exist a partially informative equilibrium in which a high (low) message is sent if $\theta>-2b+1/2$ (else).

** Most informative equilibrium

- equilibrium is partitional (show!)
# if one type of S prefers a high action to a low one than the same is true for all higher types (draw utility functions, i.e. quadratics, to see this)

- partition: $(0,\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{n-1},1)$
  - induced actions: $a([\theta_k,\theta_{k+1}])=(\theta_k+\theta_{k+1})/2$
  - each type must prefer the message of his partition element to message of any other partition element
  - cutoff types must be indifferent
$$\left(\frac{\theta _{k-1}}{2}+\underbrace{\frac{\theta_{k}}{2}-\theta _k-b}_{x} \right)^2=\left(\frac{\theta _{k+1}}{2}+\underbrace{\frac{\theta_{k}}{2}-\theta _k-b}_{x}\right)^2$$
$$\Leftrightarrow -(\theta_{k-1}+2x)=\theta _{k+1}+2x$$
$$\Leftrightarrow\theta _{k+1}=-\theta _{k-1}-4x=\theta_k+(\theta_k-\theta_{k-1})+4b$$

- maximum number of partition elements is bounded
- bigger differences in interests lead to less meaningful communication


** How to get $\theta_1$

$$\theta _{k+1}=\theta_k+(\theta_k-\theta_{k-1})+4b$$
- for given $\theta_1$ all partition points determined
- choose $\theta_1$ such that $\theta_n=1$
  - higher $\theta_1\quad\rightarrow$ higher $\theta_2$, $\theta_3$ \dots
  - for given $n$, (at most) one equilibrium, i.e. (at most) one $\theta_1$

** Example
- take $b=1/20$, then the following equilibria exist
  - babbling equilibrium 
  - two element partition: $(\theta _0,\theta _1,\theta _2)=(0,0.4,1)$
  - three element partition: $(\theta _0,\theta _1,\theta _2,\theta _3)=(0,2/15,7/15,1)$

- R's expected utility in three element partition

\begin{multline*}
  \int_0^{2/15}- (1/15-\theta)^2\,d\theta
  +\int_{2/15}^{7/15}-(9/30-\theta )^2\,d\theta
 \\ +\int_{7/15}^{1}-(11/15-\theta)^2\,d\theta \approx -0.0159
\end{multline*}


** Delegation
- suppose R delegates decision to S
  - what action will S take?
  
\pause
  - expected utility for R (with $b=1/20$): $\int_0^1 -(\theta +b-\theta )^2\,d\theta =-b^2=-0.0025$
- whether delegation is optimal or not depends on
   - b
   - which equilibrium is played without delegation

** Commitment

- if S could commit to tell the true state, would he do so?
- for $b=1/20$ and the three element partition S's utility is 
     - $-((1/60)-\theta )^2$ if $\theta \in [0,2/15)$
     - $-((1/4)-\theta )^2$ if $\theta \in [2/15,7/15)$
     - $-((41/60)-\theta )^2$ if $\theta \in [7/15,1)$

- if S commits, the action will be $a=\theta$ and therefore the utility of S is $-b^2=-1/400=-0.0025$
- commitment makes S better/worse off in some states of the world
- in expectation utility of S in the three part partition is

 \begin{multline*}
     \int_0^{2/15}-(1/60-\theta)^2 d\theta+\int_{2/15}^{7/15}-(1/4-\theta)^2 d\theta \\ +\int_{7/15}^1-(41/60-\theta)^2 d\theta\approx-0.01058
\end{multline*}
\vspace*{-2cm}
- commitment is valuable in expectation

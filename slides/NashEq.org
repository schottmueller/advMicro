* Nash equilibrium

** Nash equilibrium (NE)

*** Nash equilibrium                                           :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
A strategy profile $(s_1,\dots,s_I)$ is a /Nash equilibrium/ of game $\Gamma=[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$ if for every $i=1,\dots,I$
$$u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\geq u_i(s_i',s_{-i})$$
for all $s_i'\in S_i$.

***                                                         :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:


- mutual best response: let $b_i(s_{-i})$ be $\{s_i\inS_i:\;u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\geq u_i(s_i',s_{-i})\text{ for all }s_i'\in S_i\}$; then NE is an action profile $(s_1,\dots,S_I)$ such that $s_i\in b_i(s_{-i})$ for all $i$

** Nash equilibrium: interpretations
- non-paternalistic prediction
- self enforcing agreement
- stable steady state (convention)

** mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
*** mixed strategy Nash equilibrium                            :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the game $\Gamma=[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$ is a Nash equilibrium $(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_I)$ in the game $\Gamma=[I,{\Delta S_i},{u_i}]$, i.e. for every $i=1,\dots,I$
$$u_i(\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i})\geq u_i(\sigma_i',\sigma_{-i})$$
for all $\sigma_i'\in \Delta S_i$.

***                                                         :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

- by linearity of expected utility, $(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_I)$ is a mixed Nash equilibrium if and only if every action in the support of $\sigma_i$ is a best response to $\sigma_{-i}$


** Existence of Nash equilibrium

  \begin{itemize}
  \item not all games have a Nash equilibrium
  \end{itemize}

***   non-existence of NE                                         :B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 2 players ($N=\{P1,P2\}$)
    \item each player says a number ($A_i=\Re$)
    \item player that says the higher number wins \\(e.g. winner has payoff 1 while loser has payoff 0, if both say the same number each has payoff 1/2)
    \end{itemize}



** Existence

Why are we interested in existence of NE?
\begin{itemize}
\item worthwhile to search for an equilibrium
\item steady state interpretation of equilibrium, existence of NE says that the process might become stable
\item  sometimes possible to do comparative statics without computing the NE (only sensible if NE exists)
\end{itemize}


* Fixed point theorems


** Fixed point theory I
*** Fixed point                                                :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
    Let $f$ be a real function, i.e. $f:\,S\rightarrow\Re$ where $S\subseteq \Re$. A point $a\in A$ is a \emph{fixed point} of $f$ if $f(a)=a$.

***                                                         :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Does $f(x)=1$ have a fixed point? What about $f(x)=x+1$? What about $f(x)=x^2$?
  \item fixed point theory gives general conditions under which functions have fixed points
  \item fixed points for functions from $f:\;S\rightarrow \Re^n$ where $S\subseteq \Re^n$ are defined analogously
  \end{itemize}

** Fixed point theory II

*** Brouwer's fixed point theorem (1-dimensional)                 :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    Let $f:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]$ be a continuous function. Then $f$ has a fixed point.




** Fixed point theory III
*** Cournot                                                       :B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item two firms each choose a quantity $q_i$ 
  \item both firms have costs $c(q_i)=c q_i$ for some $c>0$
  \item inverse demand is $P(q_1+q_2)$ where we assume that $P$ is two times continuously differentiable with $P'<0$ and $P''\leq 0$
  \item assume that $P(1)<c$\\ $\Rightarrow$ a firm will never offer a quantity greater than 1
  \item  firm 1 chooses a quantity from $[0,1]$ to maximize profits
   $$\max_{q_1} (P(q_1+q_2)-c)q_1$$
 we get the first order condition
  $$P'(q_1+q_2)q_1+P(q_1+q_2)-c=0$$
  \end{itemize}

** Fixed point theory IV

*** Cournot (continued)                                           :B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the second order condition holds by assumption
$$P''(q_1+q_2)q_1+2P'(q_1+q_2)<0$$
\item the first order condition defines a best response function
  $q_1(q_2)$
\item the best response function is continuous because $P$ and $P'$
  are continuous by assumption
\item Brouwer: best response function has a fixed point!
\item game is symmetric $\Rightarrow$ fixed point is an
  equilibrium $\Rightarrow$ equilibrium exists
\item We showed this without being able to actually calculate the equilibrium!!!
\end{itemize}

** Fixed point theory V

*** Brouwer fixed point theorem                                   :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
  Let $S$ be a convex and compact set in $\Re^n$ and let $f:S\rightarrow S$ be a continuous function. Then there exists an $s^*\in S$ such that $f(s^*)=s^*$.

- proof uses Brouwer's fixed point theorem
- to simplify notation, we prove the theorem for $2\times 2$ games


** Proof of Nash theorem for $2\times2$ games I

- $2\times 2$ game:
|   | L    | R    |
|---+-------+-------|
| / | <     |       |
| U | a,b | c,d  |
| D | e,f | g,h	 |
- mixed strategy of P1: probability $\alpha\in[0,1]$  of playing U 
- mixed strategy of P2: probability $\beta\in[0,1]$  of playing L  
- idea of proof:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item define a function $f(\alpha,\beta)$ such that
     \begin{itemize}
     \item $f$ is continuous
     % \item if $(\alpha^*,\beta^*)$ is a Nash equilibrium, then $f(\alpha^*,\beta^*)=(\alpha^*,\beta^*)$
     \item if $f(\alpha^*,\beta^*)=(\alpha^*,\beta^*)$, then $(\alpha^*,\beta^*)$ is a Nash equilibrium of the game
     \end{itemize}
   \item use Brouwer's theorem to establish that $f$ has a fixed point
   \end{itemize}
 

** Proof of Nash theorem for $2\times2$ games II
\begin{itemize}
\item $u_1(U,\beta)=\beta a+(1-\beta) c$ is the expected utility of P1 when playing U and P2 uses the mixed strategy $\beta$
\item $u_1(U,\beta)$ is linear and therefore continuous in $\beta$
\item define 
$$g(\alpha,\beta)=max\left\{0,\frac{\alpha+u_1(U,\beta)-u_1(D,\beta)}{1+\left|u_1(U,\beta)-u_1(D,\beta)\right|}\right\} $$

\begin{itemize}
\item $g(\alpha,\beta)$ is higher than $\alpha$ if U is the best response to $\beta$ and
  lower than $\alpha$ if D is best response 
\item $g$ is continuous because $u_1$ is continuous in $\beta$
\end{itemize}

\item define
$$h(\alpha,\beta)=max\left\{0,\frac{\beta+u_2(L,\alpha)-u_2(R,\alpha)}{1+\left|u_2(L,\alpha)-u_2(R,\alpha)\right|}\right\} $$
\begin{itemize}
\item $h(\alpha,\beta)$ is higher than $\beta$ if L is best response  to $\alpha$
  and lower than $\beta$ if R is best response
\item $h$ is
  continuous because $u_2$ is continuous in $\alpha$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

** Proof of Nash theorem for $2\times2$ games III

let $f$ be defined by $$f(\alpha,\beta)=(g(\alpha,\beta),h(\alpha,\beta))$$




\begin{itemize}
\item if $f(\alpha^*,\beta^*)=(\alpha^*,\beta^*)$ then
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $g(\alpha^*,\beta^*)=\alpha^*$ $\Rightarrow$ $\alpha^*$ is best response to $\beta^*$
  \item $h(\alpha^*,\beta^*)=\beta^*$ $\Rightarrow$ $\beta^*$ is best response to $\alpha^*$
  \item $(\alpha^*,\beta^*)$ is Nash equilibrium
  \end{itemize}
every fixed point of $f$ is Nash equilibrium
\item  $f$ is continuous because $g$ and $h$ are continuous
\item Brouwer: $f$ has a fixed point
\end{itemize}

** Generalization of Nash's theorem
*** Nash theorem                                                 :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
  A strategic game $[I, \{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$ with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a finite number of players 
   \item a convex and compact action set $S_i$ (for all $i$)
  \item continuous utility functions $u_i$
  \end{itemize}
has a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies (and in pure strategies if all $u_i$ are quasi-concave in $s_i$).

* Strategic form games

** Notation

a strategic form (or "normal form") game \Gamma consists of
- set of players $I$
- an action set for each player $\{S_i\}_{i\in I}$ (usually written $\{S_i\}$)
- Bernoulli utility functions $\{u_i\}_{i\in I}$ (usually written $\{u_i\}$) where $u_i:S_1\times\dots\times S_I\rightarrow\Re$)

we write $\Gamma=[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$
*** Example: Prisoner's dilemma

|   | C    | D    |
|---+-------+-------|
| / | <     |       |
| C | -2,-2 | 0,-3  |
| D | -3,-0 | -1,-1 |

- $I$ is $\{P_1,P_2\}$
- $S_i$ is $\{C,D\}$
- $u_1$ is defined by: $u_1(D,D)=-1$, $u_1(D,C)=-3$, $u_1(C,D)=0$, $u_1(C,C)=-2$

** Interpretation of a strategic form game

1. one shot game
  - one time event
  - each player knows game 
  - rationality is common knowledge
  - actions are chosen simultaneously and independently
  -  a player can base his expectation of other player's play only on primitives of the game  
2. repeated play without strategic link
  - game is played repeatedly but with different opponents
  -  no intertemporal strategic link between games
  - players can have expectations how rational players play based on past plays

** Assumptions maintained throughout the course
- game itself is common knowledge among the players
- players are rational
   - clearly defined objective/preferences
   - unlimited analytical capabilities
- players are strategic
   - take into account that other players are similarly rational (rationality is common knowledge)
- players maximize expected utility (i.e. their preferences satisfy assumptions of von Neumann and Morgenstern's expected utility theorem)

** Language and notation
  
- /action/: an element of $S_i$ (a pure strategy)
- /action profile/: a vector $(s_1,\dots,s_I)$ with one action for every player 
- /mixed strategy/: $\sigma_i$ is a probability distribution over $S_i$, i.e. $\sigma_i\in\Delta(S_i)$
- /(mixed) strategy profile/: a vector $(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_I)$ with one strategy for every player 
- /support of a mixed strategy $\sigma_i$/: set of all actions on which $\sigma_i$ puts strictly positive probability

- $s_{-i}$: like an action profile but not including an action for player $i$, e.g. $(s_1,\dots,s_{i-1},s_{i+1},\dots,s_I)$
- $S_{-i}$: set of all possible $s_{-i}$
- $\sigma_{-i}$: as $s_{-i}$ but with mixed strategies instead of actions

* Dominance
** Dominant action
*** Strictly dominant action                                   :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
An action $s_i\in S_i$ is /strictly dominant/ for player i in game $[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$ if for all $s_i'\neq s_i$, we have
$$u_i(s_i,s_{-i})>u_i(s_i',s_{-i})$$
for all $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$.

*** Example: Prisoner's dilemma

|   | D     | C     |
|---+-------+-------|
| / | <     |       |
| D | -2,-2 | 0,-3  |
| C | -3,-0 | -1,-1 |

** Strictly dominated action
*** Strictly dominated action                                  :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
An action $s_i\in S_i$ is /strictly dominated/ for player i in game $[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$ if there exists a $\sigma_i'\in\Delta(S_i)$, such that
$$u_i(\sigma_i',s_{-i})>u_i(s_i,s_{-i})$$
for all $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$.

***                                                         :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

- note: due to expected utility assumption, there is no difference between the definition above and using $u_i(\sigma_i',\sigma_{-i})>u_i(s_i,\sigma_{-i})$ for all $\sigma_{-i}\in\prod_{j\neq i}\Delta(S_j)$ (check!)

*** Example
|   | L   | R   |
|---+-----+-----|
| / | <   |     |
| T | 3,0 | 0,1 |
| M | 1,2 | 1,0 |
| B | 0,0 | 3,1 |

** Relevance
what will a rational player do if 
  - he has a strictly dominant action?
  - he has a strictly dominated action?

*  Iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies
** Iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS) I
*** Example
Which action will a rational (and strategic) player 1 play?
|   | L   | R   |
|---+-----+-----|
| / | <   |     |
| T | 3,0 | 0,1 |
| M | 1,2 | 1,0 |
| B | 0,0 | 3,1 |

** Iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS) II
Procedure:
- eliminate all strictly dominated actions
- eliminate all actions that are strictly dominated in the remaining game
- continue until no strictly dominated action left
- (eliminate all mixed strategies that are dominated)

note:
- order of elimination does not matter for outcome of the procedure (check!)
- if rationality is common knowledge, players will not use actions eliminated in the process above

* Rationalizability
** (Never) best response
*** (Never) Best response                                      :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:

In game $[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$, strategy $\sigma_i$ is a /best response/ for player $i$ to the other players' strategies $\sigma_{-i}$ if
$$u_i(\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i})\geq u_i(\sigma_i',\sigma_{-i})$$
for all $\sigma_i'\in\Delta(S_i)$. Strategy $\sigma_i$ is a /never best response/ if there is no $\sigma_{-i}$ to which $\sigma_i$ is a best response.

***                                                         :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

- a mixed strategy is only a best response if every pure strategy in its support is a best response (by the expected utility assumption) (check!)
- a strictly dominated action is a never best response

** Rationalizability
a rational player has
 - a belief about other players' strategies
 - plays best response given his belief

if rationality is common knowledge, a rational player's belief can only put positive probability on actions that are themselve best response to a belief (of the other players) that puts only positive probability on best responses to a belief...

*** Rationalizable actions                                     :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
   
In game $[I,\{S_i\},\{u_i\}]$, the strategies surviving iterative elimination of never best responses are called /rationalizable strategies/. 

***                                                         :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

*Common knowledge of rationality implies that players play rationalizable strategies!*
- remark: "rationalizable actions" of player $i$ are those that are in the support of $i$'s rationalizable strategies \linebreak (these actions are also the pure strategies that are rationalizable)

** Rationalizability: examples

*** Example: finite game
|   | L   | R   |
|---+-----+-----|
| / | <   |     |
| T | 3,0 | 0,1 |
| M | 1,2 | 1,0 |
| B | 0,0 | 3,1 |
*** Example:  homogenous good Bertrand competition
- 2 firms with marginal costs $c\geq 0$ (zero fixed costs) compete in prices
- one consumer with unit demand and willingness to pay $v>c$

*** Example: Cournot competition
- 2 firms with marginal costs $c\in(0,1)$ (zero fixed costs) compete in quantities $q_i\geq 0$
- inverse demand $P(q_1+q_2)=1-q_1-q_2$
- firm $i$ profit: $u_i(q_1,q_2)=(1-q_1-q_2-c)q_i$

** Rationalizability and IESDS
- strictly dominated actions are never best responses
- only actions surviving IESDS can be rationalizable
- in game with more than 2 players, some actions surviving IESDS might not be rationalizable (in the way we defined it)
- for 2 player games: set of rationalizable actions and set of actions surviving IESDS are identical

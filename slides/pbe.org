- entrant can enter with two technologies (in1 and in2)
- what are the (SP)NE? 
# (in1, acc), (out,fight)
- which SPNE is a (not so) reasonable prediction?
# acc. is a better response than fight for any belief, i.e. I does better with acc. when reaching his info set; sequential rationality suggests I should play acc. but only subgame of game is game itself; hence SPNE has no bite

** Beliefs 
- at every information set $H$ the acting player has to have a belief over the nodes in $H$
*** System of beliefs
 A system of beliefs $\mu$ assigns to every node $x$ in an extensive form game $\Gamma_E$ a probability $\mu(x)\in[0,1]$ such that $\sum_{y\in H(x)}\mu(y)=1$ (where $H(x)$  is the information set in which $x$ lies).

** Sequential rationality

- sequential rational: no player wants to change his behavior in some information set given his beliefs and strategies of the other players

*** Sequential rationality
A strategy profile $\sigma$ is sequentially rational given system of beliefs $\mu$ if for every information set $H$, the player acting at $H$ cannot increase his expected utility by deviating from $\sigma_i$ at $H$:
$$\mathbb{E}[u_i(\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i})|H,\mu]\geq \mathbb{E}[u_i(\tilde\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i})|H,\mu]$$
for all $\tilde\sigma_i$ differing from $\sigma_i$ only at $H$.

- is there a belief system such that $(R,l)$ is sequentially rational? 
# yes $\mu=(1,0)$. Problem: not even a Nash equilibrium!

** Weak perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium
- beliefs should be consistent with the strategies used
   - $prob(x|H,\sigma)=\frac{prob(x|\sigma)}{\sum_{x'\in H}prob(x'|\sigma)}$ if $\sum_{x'\in H}prob(x'|\sigma)>0$
   - arbitrary $\mu_H$ if $\sum_{x'\in H}prob(x'|\sigma)=0$

*** Weak perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (weak PBE)
A profile of strategies $\sigma$ together with a system of beliefs $\mu$ is a weak PBE in an extensive form game $\Gamma_E$ if 
- $\sigma$ is sequentially rational given $\mu$,
- $\mu$ is derived from $\sigma$ using Bayes' rule at all information sets reached with positive probability under $\sigma$.

** Why "weak" PBE is (sometimes too) weak: unreasonable beliefs
   \includegraphics[width=8.25cm]{PBEunreasonableBelief}

- why is P2's belief inconsistent?
# P2's info set reached if P1 plays y but as P1 doe snot know nature's move this has to be equally probable after each of nature's moves -> reasonable belief is 1/2,1/2

* Sequential equilibrium
** Sequential equilibrium
- additional consistency requirements on ("off-path") beliefs

*** Sequential equilibrium				       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
A strategy profile $\sigma$ and belief system $\mu$ is a /sequential equilibrium/ of an extensive form game $\Gamma_E$ iff
- $\sigma$ is sequentially rational given $\mu$
- there exists a sequence of completely mixed strategy profiles $\{\sigma^k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ such that
   - $\sigma^k\rightarrow\sigma$
   - $\mu^k\rightarrow\mu$ where $\mu^k$ is the belief system derived from Bayes' rule under $\sigma^k$.

*** 							    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
- beliefs can be justified through some version of vanishingly small mistakes
- every sequential equilibrium is a weak PBE
- converse is not true: see previous two examples!

** Results on sequential equilibrium

*** Existence							  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
A sequential equilibrium exists in every finite game.

*** 								  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
If $(\sigma,\mu)$ is a sequential equilibrium, then $\sigma$ is a SPNE and $(\sigma,\mu)$ is also a weak PBE.

** Sequential equilibrium forces agreement off path 
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{fig_ft_85}

- $(\sigma,\mu)$ given is not sequential equilibrium as P2 and P3 have different beliefs about P1's deviation if P1 deviates from A

* Examples
** Example: Repeated offers I
- seller (S) has good he values 0
- buyer (B) has value $v$ for good where $v$ is private information 
   - S views $v$ as drawn from $u[0,1]$
- 2 periods: 
  - S sets a first period price $p_1$
  - B accepts or rejects
  - if rejected S sets second period price $p_2$
  - B accepts or rejects
  - if $p_2$ rejected: payoff $(0,0)$
- players discount with discount factor $\delta\in(0,1)$
  - acceptance in period $t$ leads to payoffs $(\delta^{t-1}p,\delta^{t-1}(v-p))$

** Example: Repeated offers II
- strategies
  - seller strategy
     - price $p_1$
     - $p_2(p_1)$ in case $p_1$ is rejected
  - buyer strategy
     - acceptance decision in first period $a_1(p_1,v)$, 
     - acceptance decision in second period $a_2(p_1,p_2,v)$
- system of beliefs
  - $\mu(v|p_1)$ is S's belief if $p_1$ got rejected

- solve for sequential equilibrium ("equilibrium" in the following)

** Example: Repeated offers III
- what is sequentially rational $a_2(p_1,p_2,v)$?
# accept iff $v\geq p_2$

- show: in equilibrium, if type $v$ accepts $p_1$, then all $v'>v$ will also accept $p_1$
# accept if $v-p_1-\max\{0,\delta(v-p_2(p_1))\}>0$, LHS is increasing in $v$

- what is $\mu(v|p_1)$  if types with $v\geq \bar v$ accepted $p_1$?
# $u[0,\bar v)$
- what is optimal $p_2$ if S believes that types  with $v\geq \bar v$ accepted $p_1$?
# $\max_p (\bar v - p)*p/\bar v$ -> $p=\bar v/2$

- what is B's cutoff type, i.e. the $\bar v(p_1)$ such that B accepts $p_1$ iff  $v\geq \bar v(p_1)$
# indifference condition $v-p_1=\delta(v-v/2)$ -> $\bar v(p_1)=p_1/(1-\delta/2)$

- what is equilibrium $p_1$?
# max_{p_1} p_1(1-p_1/(1-\delta/2))+\delta*(p_1/(2-\delta))^2 ????
# p_1=(1-\delta/2)^2/(2-3\delta/2)
# p_2(p_1*)=(1/4-\delta/8)/(2-3\delta)


# p_2<p_1, 

- (essentially) unique sequential equilibrium \linebreak (check that many weak PBE with different outcomes exist in this game!)
# weak PBE: take any p_1>0, on path play -- following p_1 -- as above but off path S believes that v=0 and therefore any p_1>0 and p_2>0 is rejected and he makes zero profits (while B strategy is as above)

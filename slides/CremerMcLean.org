* Introduction
** Introduction
- so far: independent types: private information creates distortions
- you have to pay rents in order to truthfully extract information
- distortions are used to reduce these information rents

- perfectly correlated types
  - shoot all agent mechanism
    - costless extraction of private information
    - no distortions needed
- today: what about imperfect correlation?

* Preliminaries
** Setup

- $I$ agents
- each agent has type $\theta_i\in\Theta_i$; $\theta_i$ is $i$'s private information
- for most of today: assume $\Theta_i$ is finite
- distribution $\phi$ over $\Theta=\Theta_1\times\dots\times\Theta_I$ (no independence assumption: types can now be correlated!)
- assume: $\phi$ has full support
- decision $x\in X$ and transfers $t_i\in\Re$
- utility function: $v_i(x,\theta_i)-t_i$
- revelation principle still holds

** Envelope theorem and revenue equivalence I
- agent $i$ 's utility when announcing $\hat\theta_i$ while being $\theta_i$ is
\begin{equation*}
U_i(\theta _i,\hat\theta _i)=  \int_{\Theta _{-i}}v_i(x(\hat\theta _i,\theta _{-i}),\theta _i)-t(\hat\theta _i,\theta _{-i})\;d\Phi(\theta _{-i}|\theta _i)
\end{equation*}
- rent when saying truth
\begin{equation*}
U_i(\theta _i)=U_i(\theta _i,\theta _i)=  \int_{\Theta _{-i}}v_i(x(\theta _i,\theta _{-i}),\theta _i)-t(\theta _i,\theta _{-i})\;d\Phi(\theta _{-i}|\theta _i)
\end{equation*}
- quick way to get envelope theorem: $U'_i(\theta _i)=\frac{\partial\,U_i}{\partial\theta _i} +\frac{\partial\,U_i}{\partial \hat\theta _i}\frac{d\hat\theta_i}{d\theta _i}$ and then use that $\frac{\partial\,U_i}{\partial\hat\theta _i}=0$
- revenue equivalence: as $U_i'$ does not depend on $t_i$, $t_i$ is determined (up to a constant) by the decision rule $x$ (on which $U_i'$ depends)
- problem now: $\partial\,U_i/\partial\theta _i$ still contains $t_i$ (because we have to consider $\partial\Phi(\theta _{-i}|\theta _i)/\partial\theta_i$)
- revenue equivalence no longer holds!
** Envelope theorem and revenue equivalence II
- the $t_i$ play a direct role for incentive compatibility\par before:\linebreak when $x$ is non-decreasing, then the mechanism $(x,t)$ is incentive compatible where transfers are given by the envelope condition (which did not contain $t_i$)

** Cremer-McLean condition I
- assume finite $\Theta$
- if $i$ has type $\theta _i$ his beliefs about $\theta _{-i}$ are derived from Bayes' rule
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)=\frac{\phi(\theta_{-i},\theta_i)}{\sum_{\theta_{-i'}\in\Theta_{-i}}\phi(\theta_{-i}',\theta_i)}
\end{equation*}

** Cremer-McLean condition III
- write your beliefs $\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)$ as a vector $\tilde\phi(\theta_i)$ (for each $\theta_{-i}\in\Theta_{-i}$ one entry in the vector)
- write down these vectors for each type $\theta_i$ you can have
- Cremer-McLean condition: no such vector $\tilde\phi(\theta_i)$ is a convex combination of the other vectors in $\{\tilde\phi(\theta_i'):\;\theta_i\neq\theta_i'\in\Theta_i\}$

The distribution $\phi$ satisfies the Cremer-McLean condition if there is no agent $i$ with type $\theta_i\in\Theta_i$ and $\lambda_i:\Theta_i\setminus\{\theta_i\}\rightarrow\Re_+$  such that
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(\theta _{-i}|\theta _i)=\sum_{\theta _i'\in\Theta_i\setminus\{\theta_i\}}\lambda_i(\theta_i')\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i')\qquad\text{for all }\theta_{-i}\in\Theta_{-i}.

** Cremer-McLean condition IV
- condition is satisfied if and only if belief $\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)$ is not in the convex hull of $\{\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i'):\;\theta_i'\neq\theta_i \}$ for all players and all types
# - (condition is satisfied if $\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)$ is not in the space spanned by $\{\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i'):\;\theta_i'\neq\theta_i \}$ )
- is the condition satisfied if types are distributed independently?
# no
- is the condition satisfied if types are perfectly correlated?
# yes
- is the condition satisfied in the example?

* Cremer-McLean result
** Cremer-McLean possibility result I
*** Cremer-McLean possibility result				  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
Let $\phi$ satisfy the Cremer-McLean condition. Consider a mechanism $(x,t)$ (possibly not incentive compatible!). Then there is a direct mechanism $(x,t')$ such that
   - $(x,t')$ is Bayesian incentive compatible
   - both mechanisms have the same decision rule $x$
   - both mechanism have the same interim expected payoffs
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{\theta _{-i}\in\Theta _{-i}}t_i(\theta _i,\theta _{-i})\phi(\theta _{-i}|\theta _i)=  \sum_{\theta _{-i}\in\Theta _{-i}}t_i'(\theta _i,\theta _{-i})\phi(\theta _{-i}|\theta _i)
\end{equation*}
*** 							    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
- same interim utilities
- incentive compatibility comes "for free"
- same result as in the perfect correlation case 
** Cremer-McLean possibility result II
*** Trade/Auction					  :B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:
- seller wants to sell indivisible good to one of $n$ bidders at a price equal to the highest bidder's valuation
# result says there is an equivalent mech with same interim utilities and therefore same expected revenues as the mechanism above

** Proof idea I
- let us forget about the allocation $x$ and think about how to elicit private beliefs truthfully
   - say there is a state of the world $w\in\Omega$ and an expert has private information about how likely each state is
   - you offer the expert the following scheme
      - expert announces a probability $\pi(w)$ for each $w\in\Omega$ (and those probabilities have to sum to 1)
      - when the state realizes, the expert has to pay  $k-log(\pi(w))$
   - if the expert's believe is $\hat\pi$, what probabilities will he announce?
\begin{equation*}
  \min_{\pi(w)}\sum_{w\in\Omega}\left(k-log(\pi(w))\right)\hat\pi(w)
\end{equation*}
subject to $\sum_{w\in\Omega}\pi(w)=1$.
# write Lagrangian and show that $\hat\pi(w)/\pi(w)=\mu$ where $\mu$ is Lagange parameter and therefore (as relative proportion is same for all $w$) truth announcing is optimal

** Proof idea II

- back to our mechanism design problem 
   - if we had transfers $t_i(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})+c(k-log(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i))$ and $c$ is very high, then revelation incentives trump allocation incentives, i.e. truthtelling is optimal
   - but: to get result we need for every type a ``revelation payment/lottery'' that is  (i) zero in expectation  when truthfully announced (ii) positive in expectation for all other types 
   - Cremer-McLean condition ensures that each type has a different belief --> extracting a player's belief is equivalent to extracting his type

** Proof 
- pick type $\theta_i$ of agent $i$
- Cremer-McLean condition: $\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)$ is not in the convex hull of $\{\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i'):\;\theta_i'\neq\theta_i \}$ 
- separating hyperplane theorem: there exists a vector $y_{\theta_i}$ such that $y_{\theta_i}\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i)=0$ and $y_{\theta_i}x>0$ for all $x\in co\left(\{\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i'):\;\theta_i'\neq\theta_i \}\right)$ \linebreak $\Rightarrow$   $y_{\theta_i}\phi(\theta_{-i}|\theta_i')>0$ for all $\theta_i'\neq \theta_i$
- interpretation: 
  - $y_{\theta_i}$ has as many elements as $\Theta _{-i}$: \par each entry corresponds to a $\theta _{-i}$ in the sense that agent $i$ has to pay this amount if he reports $\theta _i$ and other agents report $\theta _{-i}$
  - player $i$ chooses from lotteries $\{y_{\theta_i}:\;\theta_i\in\Theta_i\}$ \linebreak \rightarrow optimal to choose lottery for his actual type 
- scale the revelation payments up by multiplying all $y_{\theta_i}$ by some $c>0$ such that revelation incentives trump allocation incentives

** Example I
- sale of an indivisible object
- 2 buyers with valuation either 4 or 2
- type distribution
| type | high | low |
|------+------+-----|
| /    |<     |     |
| high | 1/3  | 1/6 |
| low  | 1/6  | 1/3 |
- allocation rule
| type | high    | low     |
|------+---------+---------|
| /    |<        |         |
| high | 1/2,1/2 | 1,0     |
| low  | 0,1     | 1/2,1/2 |
- transfers $t(\theta_1,\theta_2)$
| type | high | low |
|------+------+-----|
| /    | <    |     |
| high | 2,2  | 4,0 |
| low  | 0,4  | 1,1 |

** Example II
- let's take $\theta_1=4$,  $\phi(\theta_2|4)=\begin{pmatrix}2/3\\1/3\end{pmatrix}$ and $\phi(\theta_2|2)=\begin{pmatrix}1/3\\2/3\end{pmatrix}$ 
- now we want to have a $y_4$ such that\par $y_4\tilde\phi(\theta_2|4)=0$ and $y_4\phi(\theta_2|2)>0$, i.e.

\begin{align*}  
2y^1_4/3+y^2_4/3&=0\\  
y^1_4/3+2y^2_4/3&>0 
\end{align*} 

say $y_4=\begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}$

** Example III
- similar steps show that for $\theta_1=2$ we get $y_2=\begin{pmatrix}2 \\-1\end{pmatrix}$
- $t'_1(\theta_1,\theta_2)=t_1(\theta_1,\theta_2)+c  y_{\theta_1}(\theta_1,\theta_2)$
- choose $c>0$ high enough to ensure truthful revelation
   - consider type $\theta_1=4$:
     - truthtelling gives an expected payoff of $$\hspace*{-0.5cm}U_1(4,4)=\frac{2}{3}\left(4/2-2-c\left(-1\right)\right)+\frac{1}{3}\left(4-4-c2\right)=0$$
     - lying gives an expected payoff of $$\hspace*{-0.5cm}U_1(4,2)=\frac{2}{3}\left(0-0-c2\right)+\frac{1}{3}\left(4/2-1-c\left(-1\right)\right)=\frac{1}{3}-c$$
- $c\geq 1/3$ will ensure that type $\theta_1=4$ tells the truth

** Example IV
- zero expected surplus for all types of all buyers
- efficient allocation
- seller extracts full rent 


* Discussion
** Discussion
- result is surprising; perhaps best understood as a paradox
- some caveats
   - required (out of equilibrium) payments can be very large
      - risk aversion
      - budget constraints
   - mechanism possibly creates substantial collusion incentives
   - debate how restrictive Cremer-McLean condition is
      - payoff type determines belief type (crucial to obtain result) $\rightarrow$ robustness?
   - mechanism requires precise knowledge of agents' beliefs

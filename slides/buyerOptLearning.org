* Some Maths

** Mathematical questions

- when is a random variable (distribution) "higher" than another?
- when is a random variable more dispersed (i.e. spread out) than another? 


** Mathematical answers
- "higher": $F$ *first order stochastically dominates* $G$ if $F(x)\leq G(x)$ for all $x\in\Re$. 

- "more dispersed 1": $F$ *second order stochastically dominates* $G$ if $\int_{-\infty}^x F(y)\,dy \leq \int_{-\infty}^x G(y)\,dy$ for all $x\in\Re$.

- "more dispersed 2": A random variable /x/ with distribution $F$ is a *mean preserving spread* of a random variable $s$ if there is a random variable /z/ with $\mathbb{E}[z|s]=0$ such that the distribution of $s+z$ is /F/.

*** Result
If two random variables /x/ and /s/ have the same mean, then /s/ second order stochastically dominates /x/ if and only if /x/ is a mean preserving spread of /s/.


* Introduction
** Introduction
- how much do you value a new PC?
- will customer reviews and other online product information sources increase consumer surplus?

\pause

\vspace*{0.5cm}
- direct effect vs. pricing response

\vspace*{0.5cm}
- can we predict (a range of) possible profits and consumer surplus without knowing what information consumers have?

* Model
** Model
- buyer value $v$ distributed on $[0,1]$ according to cdf $F$
- \mu is expected valuation under $F$
- buyer does not know $v$ but receives private signal $s$ (correlated with $v$)
- seller knows neither $v$ nor $s$
- joint distribution of $s$ and $v$ is commonly known
\vspace*{0.2cm}
- seller sets price /p/ to maximize expected profits (zero costs)
- buyer decides whether to buy maxmizing expected $v-p$
\vspace*{0.2cm}
- without loss of generality $s=\mathbb{E}(v|s)$
- $v$ has to be a mean preserving spread of $s$

** Illustration
- let $F$ be uniform distribution on $[0,1]$
- suppose buyer has complete information ($s=v$)
   - optimal price? 
# p=1/2
   - consumer surplus?
# CS=1/8

- suppose signal is either "low" or "high"
   - low if $v\in[0.1,0.6]$ 
   - high else
   - expected /v/ given high (low) signal?
# l=0.35, h = 0.65
   - optimal /p/?, expected consumer surplus?
# p=0.35>0.65/2, CS = 1/2-0.35=0.15>1/8


* Analysis

** Feasible signal distributions
The distribution of signals $G$ is feasible if and only if $F$ is a mean preserving spread of $G$, that is:
- the expected value of $G$ equals the expected value of $F$
- SOSD: $\int_0^x F(v)\,dv\geq\int_0^xG(s)\,ds$ for all $x\in[0,1]$, i.e. $F$ is more spread out than  $G$.

*** Outcome 						       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
$(G,p)$ is an outcome if $G$ is a feasible distribution of signals and $p$ is a profit maximizing price given signal distribution $G$.

** key of the analysis I
*** Lemma
Let $(G,p)$ be an outcome leading to expected profit $\pi$. Then there is an outcome $(G_\pi^B,\pi)$ where
\[G_\pi^B(s)=\begin{cases}0&\text{ if }s\in[0,\pi)\\ 1-\pi/s & \text{ if }s\in[\pi,B)\\1&\text{ if }s\geq B \end{cases} \]
 such that (i) $G$ is a mean preserving spread of $G_\pi^B$ and (ii) expected consumer surplus under $(G_\pi^B,\pi)$ is at least as high as under $(G,p)$.

- note: $G_\pi^B$ has a mass point with mass $\pi/B$ at $B$
- implication: without loss of generality we can focus on $G_\pi^B$

** key to analysis II

Proof of lemma:
- $\pi$ is a profit maximizing price (at which every type of buyer buys)
# leads to profit \pi, prices in (\pi,B] also lead to profit \pi, price above B leads to 0 demand and profit
- expected consumer surplus is at least as high under $G_\pi^B$ as under $G$
# CS=\mu-\pi, as profits are \pi under both distributions and expected gross consumer value can never be higher than \mu, the result follows
- there is a unique $B$ such that $G_\pi^B$ has expected value $\mu$
# expected value of $G_\pi^B$ is increasing in B (higher B shifts mass from old B to higher values); $G_\pi^\pi$ is a unit mass on \pi\leq \mu; to show: $G_\pi^1$ has expected value above \mu: by optimality of p for G we have $\pi\geq s(1-G(s)+\Delta G(s))$ for all $s\in[0,1]$ which is equivalent to $1-\pi/s\leq G(s)-\Delta G(s)$ and therefore $G_\pi^1(s)\leq G(s)$, i.e. G_\pi^1\succ_{FOSD} G and has a higher expected value than $G$
-  $G_\pi^B\succeq_{SOSD}G$ and therefore $G_\pi^B$ is feasible
# as $G_\pi^B(s)=G_\pi^1(s)$ for $s<B$, the FOSD above implies the result for those $s$. Take $s\geq B$. Note that the expected value for a distribution H equals $\int_0^1H(x)\,dx$ (using integration by parts. Hence, $\int_0^s G(x)\,dx=1-\mu-\int_s^1G(x)\,dx\geq 1-\mu-(1-s)=\mu-\int_s^1G_\pi^B(x)\,dx=\int_0^sG_\pi^B(x)dx$

** Result
*** Optimal information
The buyer-optimal distribution of signals is given by 
\[G_q^B(s)=\begin{cases}0&\text{ if }s\in[0,q)\\ 1-q/s & \text{ if }s\in[q,B)\\1&\text{ if }s\geq B \end{cases} \]
where /q/ is the price charged in equilibrium and /q/ and /B/ are chosen such that /q/ is the lowest among all $(q,B)$ for which $G_q^B$ satisfies both the expected value and SOSD constraint.

\textbf{Proof:} As lower prices lead to higher consumer surplus, this is a direct implication of the lemma.\qed

# ** Heuristic proof
# Let $G^*$  and $p^*$ be optimal

# 1. All buyers buy.
# If not, one can merge types below p^*$ with types at and slightly above p^* to a new type p'<p^* such that profits when chargin p' in the modified problem are equal to profits in the original problem when charging p^*. Hence, welfare increases (as all types have vabove zero costs) while profits remain constant -> CS up.

# 2. Seller has to be indifferent between all prices above $p^*$ (that give positive demand).
# suppose not, i.e. p\in(p',p'+epsilon) gives strictly lower profits than p^*. Then pushing up the values of some types just below p' to values just above p' gives higher CS while leaving p^* as optimal price. In order not to violate expected value constraint, merge types at and some just above p^* and give them valuation p^*-\epsilon such that p^*-\epsilon is new optimal price. (By full support assumption SOSD constraint cannot bind around p^*>0.)

# 3. $G^*$ has no mass point at $p^*$.
# directly implied by 2: If there was mass point, p^* would give higher profit than p^*+\epsilon.

# Hence: $G^*=G_q^B$

# 4. For each /q/, there is (at most) one /B/ that satisfies expected value constraint.
# expected value of G^* is strictly increasing in $B$

# 5. Choose lowest /q/ satisfying both constraints
# q will be the price and as every type buys the lowest q leads to highest CS

** Robust outcome prediction
- for every $q\in[p^*,\mu]$ there is a $B$ such that $G_q^B$ is feasible 
# for q>p^*, G_q^B (where B chosen to satisfy expected value constraint) is more concentrated than optimal G^* --> SOSD fine
- different optimal prices generate outcome triangle $(\mu-p^*)$, $(0,p^*)$, $(0,\mu)$
